# Meet and Sell UI Design in React

photos of the design are located in the public folder under Meet and Sell

Welcome to the Meet and Sell UI design project, created by Don Miller. This project showcases a user-friendly user interface built with React, designed for an online marketplace. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate this UI into your project or simply interested in exploring the design, this README will guide you through the key features and components of this project.

## Screenshots

To give you a quick preview of the design, here are three different background variants of the Meet and Sell UI:


These background variants are controlled through comments in the `index.html` file, allowing you to easily switch between them based on your preferences.

## Image Credits

All the images used for the items being sold in the UI are sourced from Pixabay, a platform for high-quality, free stock photos. We appreciate their contribution to this project, and you can find these images on Pixabay's website for your own use.

## Favicon

The favicon used in this project was originally created by a logo generator. It serves as a distinctive icon representing Meet and Sell. Feel free to replace it with your own favicon to personalize your project further.

## Built With

This UI design was created using the following technologies and libraries:

- **React**: The project is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Bootstrap React**: The navigation bar and cards in this design are implemented using Bootstrap React components. Bootstrap simplifies the process of creating responsive and attractive UI elements.

## Getting Started

To get started with this UI design, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/DonMiller9294/meetandsell.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```shell
   cd meet-and-sell-ui
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies.

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server.

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

Now, you can access the Meet and Sell UI in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. Feel free to explore and customize the design to fit your project's needs.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
